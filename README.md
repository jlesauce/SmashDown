# Smash Down

SmashDown is a Python-based badminton tournament management system that helps organizers manage tournaments for double
matches. The system generates random team pairings for each match, updates player rankings after each round, and ensures
that each team plays against every other team exactly once.

## Features

* Random team pairing: The system uses a random team pairing algorithm to ensure that teams are created randomly for
  each match.
* Round-robin tournament: The system implements a round-robin tournament approach, where each team plays every other
  team exactly once.
* Automatic updates: The system updates player rankings after each round based on individual performance in the matches.
* User-friendly interface: The system provides a simple and intuitive user interface to facilitate the tournament
  management process.
* Customizable settings: The system allows organizers to customize tournament settings, including the number of teams,
  the number of rounds, and the ranking criteria.
